Added folders to show how I might organize the project as it gets larger.

Taking functional approach. I have some the linter to ensure objects are not mutated.

Added some tests and logic to make the parsing hardy to formatting inconsitencies. In a real life situation 
I would be asking questions about what is generating this input. If it is a computer, 
and guaranteed to be properly formatting these additional checks add no value.
